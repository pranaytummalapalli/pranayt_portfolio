        I started Akshar Bionics in Jan 2021, along with five of my teammates. We envisioned to solve learning disparities between children with hearing disabilities and ones with normal hearing by introducing a robotic hand in regular classrooms that translated the teachers words into sign language in real time.

        In 2018, we were selected, among a handful of teams from our college to participate in the “Drones and Robotics” track of the  prestigious Smart India Hackathon Hardware Edition 2018, which is a National Level Hackathon organised by the Government of India.

        The Grand Finale of the Hackathon was hosted by Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur, where we won 1st place among 17 teams from across different colleges in India. After the hackathon, we received a grant of INR 10 Lakhs from the Ministry Innovation Council (MIC), Ministry of Education, Govt. Of India. We utilised this grant to further develop the prototype and manufacture the arm using 3D printing. We conducted several surveys to validate our idea.

        Apart from developing the arm for translation, we saw the potential of the arm to be used for upper limb prosthesis. With this new approach, later versions of the arm had modular joints which can be stacked as per the need of the patient. At the end we were able to achieve the development of a an arm from the shoulder joint to each individually actuated finger.

        The project served as a foundation for the core engineering skills I gained and formed a base for my design thinking approach. Since our college did not have a mechanical department, i learnt core mechanical design from YouTube and designed the robotic arm in Autodesk Fusion 360. I also gained exposure to enchance my core skills such as embedded software and robotics system design.

        The project gave me the opportunity to learn 3D printing which brought out the maker in me. During COVID I took the opportunity to build few other smaller projects that I still use at home.
