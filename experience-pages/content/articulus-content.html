        I joined Articulus Surgical at its inception as a founding team member and one of its first contributors. The vision for an indigenous sustainable and accessible RAS system that caters to the need to bring the advancements in medical technology to the people who cant yet afford it, is what served as a northern star for us.

        Articulus is a team of young high-aiming engineers from diverse backgrounds, founded by Mr. Saurya Mishra a post-grad from IIT Kharagpur with over 12 years of experience in medical devices in companies like Phillips Healthcare.

        I started my journey at Articulus as a mechatronics engineer in November 2021 where I was tasked with ideating and subsequently developing the mechanisms for the 6DOF remote centre robot, which was based on a circular carriage-driver gantry.

        Thereafter, I owned the end-to-end design and development of the surgeon’s console. This involved designing the joints and structure of a 7DOF serial manipulator. Since we opted for a console with passive joints, gravity compensation using counterbalance initially and later springs, was a challenge. The mechanism that i designed was reviewed as “as smooth as a motor-driver mechanism” by a few doctors and investors.  Apart from mechanical design, i was responsible for the Industrial design and user experience for all the projects in R&D.

        Since the team was small, I also developed the firmware on an ESP32 using the ESP-IDF framework to read the joint absolute encoders and convert them to joint angles. The data stream was then transmitted to a computer using RS232, where it was input into a forward kinematics model to get the end-effector parameters. 

        Later on, I got a hands-on introduction to PID controller design and tuning for DC motors. This was implemented on an RP2040 MCU using the PICO-SDK framework and deployed on the robot joint actuators.

        As a spin-off project, I was tasked with the design of a handheld motorised laparoscopic instrument to control a 3DOF instrument end-effector. The concept for the capstan mechanism was borrowed from the Pulsar Instrument. The movement of the surgeon’s arm was encoded using  a 3DOF gimbal to translate each of the X Y and Z axis rotations to joint angles.
