        Meril is a brand-name in the global medical device landscape, 
        with its research and development efforts benefiting the Indian Healthcare 
        sector spearheaded by the scale of its cardiovascular stents and orthopaedic 
        implants manufacturing capability. During my tenure at Meril, I worked at the 
        R&D Endosurgery & Robotics department. 

        MISSO Robot Assisted Laparoscopy 

        My primary role is contributing towards the embedded firmware design and development 
        for different sub-systems of the in-house RAS system MISSO. As part of my tasks, I am 
        responsible for the end-to-end firmware development and deployment of our In-House EtherCAT 
        based motor driver to control BLDC motors to actuate the instrument DOFs, as well as the 
        joints of our in-house 7DOF arm. I also took ownership of sourcing and integration 
        of high-quality 7‚Äù touchscreens to run our GUI. This involved optimising the linux 
        based operating system using a real-time kernel to run the software on a performance 
        constrained Intel Atom x6425 processor.

        MISSO Robot Assisted Orthopaedics

        As a collaborative effort, our team also contributed toward the design and development 
        of the MISSO Orthopaedic Surgical Robot. My role was to scale the custom linux based 
        operating system to 200+ systems by scripting the customisations.

        Delegation to China for CMEF2024

        I was selected as part of a small team of delegation from the company to attend  
        CMEF2024 in Shanghai, China in April 2024. During the exhibition, I got hands-on 
        experience with 6 different Chinese Surgical Robotics which included both single 
        port and multi-port robots. As part of the delegation, we also visited 16 Robotics 
        startups and research institutes. These included Mobile warehouse robots, Humanoids, 
        bionic hands, Quadrupeds and exoskeletons for rehabilitation. I gained invaluable 
        exposure to different branches in robotics and a vast set of architectures. 
        I experienced the advancement of the field hands-on.

        I also experienced the varied difference in the cultures of India and China from 
        food to communication.
